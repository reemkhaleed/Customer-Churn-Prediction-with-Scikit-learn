# Customer-Churn-Prediction-with-Scikit-learn
An end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting customer churn using a Kaggle telecom dataset. This project includes data loading, cleaning, preprocessing, feature encoding, and model training with hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV. Evaluation is performed using classification metrics and AUC score.
